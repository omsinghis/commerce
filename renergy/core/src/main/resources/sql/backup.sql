India was the first country in the world to set up a ministry of non-conventional energy resources, in early 1980s. However its success has been very spotty. In recent years India has been lagging behind other nations in the use of renewable energy (RE). The share of RE in the energy sector, as on March 2011, is 10.63% of total generation capacity of India. Renewable energy in India comes under the purview of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.</p><p>Recent data and analyses have made it clear that the emissions savings from adding wind energy to the grid are even larger than had been commonly thought. In addition to each kilowatt-hour (kWh) of wind energy directly offsetting a kWh that would have been produced by a fossil-fired power plant, new analyses show that wind plants further reduce emissions by forcing the most polluting and inflexible power plants offline and causing them to be replaced by more efficient and flexible types of generation.</p><p>At the same time, and in spite of the overwhelming evidence to the contrary, the fossil fuel industry has launched an increasingly desperate misinformation campaign to convince the American public that wind energy does not actually reduce carbon dioxide emissions. As a result, we feel compelled to set the record straight on the matter, once and for all.</p><p><strong>Fossil Fuel&rsquo;s Desperate War against Facts</strong></p><p>Not to be deterred by indisputable data, numerous refutations, or the laws of physics, the fossil fuel lobby has doubled down on their desperate effort to muddy the waters about one of the universally recognized and uncontestable benefits of wind energy: that it reduces the use of fossil fuels as well as the emissions and other environmental damage associated with producing and using these fuels.</p><p>For those who have not been following this misinformation campaign by the fossil fuel industry, here is a brief synopsis. Back in March 2010, AWEA heard public reports that the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States (IPAMS), a lobby group representing the oil and natural gas industry, was working on a report that would attempt to claim that adding wind energy to the grid had somehow increased power plant emissions in Colorado.</p><p>Perplexed at how anyone would attempt to make that claim, AWEA decided to take a look at the relevant data, namely the U.S. Department of Energy&rsquo;s data tracking emissions from Colorado&rsquo;s power plants over time. The government&rsquo;s data, reproduced in the table below, show that as wind energy jumped from providing 2.5% of Colorado&rsquo;s electricity in 2007 to 6.1% of the state&rsquo;s electricity in 2008, carbon dioxide emissions fell by 4.4%, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions fell by 6%, coal use fell by 3% (571,000 tons), and electric-sector natural gas use fell by 14%. (Thorough DOE citations for each data point are listed here (PDF).) Two conclusions were apparent from looking at this data: 1. the claim the fossil fuel industry was planning to make had no basis in fact, and 2. the fossil industry was understandably frustrated that they were losing market share to wind energy.</p><p>In early April, AWEA publicly presented this government data, and when the fossil fuel lobbyists released their report later that month it was greeted with the skepticism it deserved and largely ignored. Case closed, right? We thought so, too.</p><p>After the initial release of the report fell flat, the fossil fuel industry tried again a month later. John Andrews, founder of the Independence Institute, a group that has received hundreds of thousands of dollars in funding from the fossil fuel industry, penned an opinion article in the Denver Post parroting the claims of the original report. Fortunately, Frank Prager, a vice president with Xcel Energy, the owner of the Colorado power plants in question, responded with an article entitled &ldquo;Setting the record straight on wind energy&rdquo; that pointed out the flaws in the fossil industry&rsquo;s study and reconfirmed that wind in fact has significantly reduced fossil fuel use and emissions on their power system. Having been shot down twice, we thought that the fossil industry would surely put their report out to pasture.</p><p>Yet just a month later the report resurfaced, this time in Congressional testimony by the Institute for Energy Research, a DC-based group that receives a large amount of funding from many of the same fossil fuel companies that fund the Independence Institute. The group has continued trumpeting the report&rsquo;s myths at public events around the country and on their website, and these myths are now beginning to spread through the pro-fossil fuel blogosphere. In recent days, these myths have re-appeared in columns by Robert Bryce, a senior fellow at the fossil-funded Manhattan Institute.</p><p>The fossil fuel industry&rsquo;s desperate persistence and deep pockets make for a dangerous combination when it comes to distorting reality, so we&rsquo;d like to once and for all clarify the facts about how wind energy reduces fossil fuel use and emissions.</p><p><strong>The Truth about Wind and Emissions.</strong></p><p>The electricity produced by a wind plant must be matched by an equivalent decrease in electricity production at another power plant, as the laws of physics dictate that utility system operators must balance the total supply of electricity with the total demand for electricity at all times. Adding wind energy to the grid typically displaces output from the power plant with the highest marginal operating cost that is online at that time, which is almost always a fossil-fired plant because of their high fuel costs. Wind energy is also occasionally used to reduce the output of hydroelectric dams, which can store water to be used later to replace more expensive fossil fuel generation.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s call this direct reduction in fossil fuel use and emissions Factor A. Factor A is by far the largest impact of adding wind energy to the power system, and the emissions reductions associated with Factor A are indisputable because they are dictated by the laws of physics.</p><p>In some instances, there may also be two other factors at play: a smaller one that can slightly increase emissions (let&rsquo;s call it Factor B), and a counteracting much larger one that, when netted with B, will further add to the emissions reductions achieved under Factor A (let&rsquo;s call this third one Factor C).</p><p>Factor B was discussed at length in an AWEA fact sheet (PDF) published several years ago. This factor accounts for the fact that, in some instances, reducing the output of a fossil-powered plant to respond to the addition of wind energy to the grid can cause a very small reduction in the efficiency of that fossil-fueled power plant. It is important to note that this reduction in efficiency is on a per-unit-of-output basis, so because total output from the fossil plant has decreased the net effect is to decrease emissions.</p><p>As a conservative hypothetical example, adding 100 MW of wind energy output to the grid might cause a fossil plant to go from producing 500 MW at 1000 pounds of CO2 per megawatt-hour (MWh) (250 tons of CO2 per hour) to producing 400 MW at 1010 pounds of CO2/MWh (202 tons of CO2 per hour), so the net impact on emissions from adding 100 MW of wind would be CO2 emissions reductions of 48 tons per hour. Unfortunately, fossil-funded groups have focused nearly all of their attention on Factor B, which in this example accounts for 2 tons, while completely ignoring the 50 tons of initial emissions reductions associated with Factor A. (See Footnote 1.) A conservative estimate is that the impact of Factor B is at most a few percent of the emissions reductions achieved through factor A.</p><p>Factor C is rarely included in discussions of wind&rsquo;s impact on the power system and emissions, but the impact of Factor C is far larger than that of Factor B, so that it completely negates any emissions increase associated with Factor B. Factor C is the decrease in emissions that occurs as utilities and grid operators respond to the addition of wind energy by decreasing their reliance on inflexible coal power plants and instead increase their use of more flexible &ndash; and less polluting &ndash; natural gas power plants. This occurs because coal plants are poorly suited for accommodating the incremental increase in overall power system variability associated with adding wind energy to the grid, while natural gas plants tend to be far more flexible. (Footnote 2)</p><p>To summarize, the net effect of Factors A, B, and C is to reduce emissions by even more than is directly offset from wind generation displacing fossil generation (Factor A).</p><p><strong>Study after Study</strong></p><p>Unsurprisingly, government studies and grid operator data show that this is exactly what has happened to the power system as wind energy has been added. A study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) released in January 2010 found drastic reductions in both fossil fuel use and carbon dioxide emissions as wind energy is added to the grid. The Eastern Wind Integration and Transmission Study (EWITS) used in-depth power system modeling to examine the impacts of integrating 20% or 30% wind power into the Eastern U.S. power grid.</p><p>The EWITS study found that carbon dioxide emissions would decrease by more than 25% in the 20% wind energy scenario and 37% in the 30% wind energy scenario, compared to a scenario in which our current generation mix was used to meet increasing electricity demand. The study also found that wind energy will drastically reduce coal generation, which declined by around 23% from the business-as-usual case to the 20% wind cases, and by 35% in the 30% wind case. These results were corroborated by the DOE&rsquo;s 2008 technical report, &ldquo;20% Wind Energy by 2030,&rdquo; which also found that obtaining 20% of the nation&rsquo;s electricity from wind energy would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 25%.</p><p>The fact that this study found emissions savings to be even larger than the amount directly offset by adding wind energy is a powerful testament to the role of Factor C in producing bonus emissions savings. By running scenarios in which wind energy&rsquo;s variability and uncertainty were removed, NREL&rsquo;s EWITS study was able to determine that it was in fact these attributes of wind energy that were causing coal plants to be replaced by more flexible natural gas plants. (See page 174 of the study.)</p><p>As further evidence, four of the seven major independent grid operators in the U.S. have studied the emissions impact of adding wind energy to their power grids, and all four have found that adding wind energy drastically reduces emissions of carbon dioxide and other harmful pollutants. While the emissions savings depend somewhat on the existing share of coal-fired versus gas-fired generation in the region, as one would expect, it is impossible to dispute the findings of these four independent grid operators that adding wind energy to their grids has significantly reduced emissions. The results of these studies are summarized below.</p>');

In the context of biomass for energy this is often used to mean plant based material, but biomass can equally apply to both animal and vegetable derived material.</p><p><strong>Chemical composition</strong></p><p>Biomass is carbon based and is composed of a mixture of organic molecules containing hydrogen, usually including atoms of oxygen, often nitrogen and also small quantities of other atoms, including alkali, alkaline earth and heavy metals. These metals are often found in functional molecules such as the porphyrins which include chlorophyll which contains magnesium.</p><p><strong>Plant material</strong></p><p>The carbon used to construct biomass is absorbed from the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO2) by plant life, using energy from the sun.</p><p>Plants may subsequently be eaten by animals and thus converted into animal biomass. However the primary absorption is performed by plants.</p><p>If plant material is not eaten it is generally either broken down by microrganisms or burned:</p><p>If broken down it releases the carbon back to the atmosphere, mainly as either carbon dioxide (CO2) or methane (CH4), depending upon the conditions and processes involved. If burned the carbon is returned to the atmosphere as CO2. These processes have happened for as long as there have been plants on Earth and is part of what is known as the carbon cycle. Fossil fuels Fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas are also derived from biological material, however material that absorbed CO2 from the atmosphere many millions of years ago. As fuels they offer high energy density, but making use of that energy involves burning the fuel, with the oxidation of the carbon to carbon dioxide and the hydrogen to water (vapour). Unless they are captured and stored, these combustion products are usually released to the atmosphere, returning carbon sequestered millions of years ago and thus contributing to increased atmospheric concentrations. The difference between biomass and fossil fuels The vital difference between biomass and fossil fuels is one of time scale. Biomass takes carbon out of the atmosphere while it is growing, and returns it as it is burned. If it is managed on a sustainable basis, biomass is harvested as part of a constantly replenished crop. This is either during woodland or arboricultural management or coppicing or as part of a continuous programme of replanting with the new growth taking up CO2 from the atmosphere at the same time as it is released by combustion of the previous harvest. This maintains a closed carbon cycle with no net increase in atmospheric CO2 levels. Categories of biomass materials Within this definition, biomass for energy can include a wide range of materials. The realities of the economics mean that high value material for which there is an alternative market, such as good quality, large timber, are very unlikely to become available for energy applications. However there are huge resources of residues, co-products and waste that exist in the UK which could potentially become available, in quantity, at relatively low cost, or even negative cost where there is currently a requirement to pay for disposal. There are five basic categories of material: Virgin wood, from forestry, arboricultural activities or from wood processing Energy crops: high yield crops grown specifically for energy applications Agricultural residues: residues from agriculture harvesting or processing Food waste, from food and drink manufacture, preparation and processing, and post-consumer waste Industrial waste and co-products from manufacturing and industrial processes. Types of fuels Conversion technologies As there is wide diversity in the characteristics and properties of these different classes of material, and their various sub-groups, there is also a wide range of conversion technologies to make optimum use of them, which include both thermal and chemical conversion technologies.

This has necessitated the country to start aggressively pursuing alternative energy sources - solar, wind, biofuels, small hydro and more.<br /><br />Sustainable energy investment in India went up to US$ 3.7 billion in 2008, up 12 per cent since 2007 and this is likely to increase much more in the coming years. It included asset finance of US$ 3.2 billion, up by 36 per cent. Venture capital and private equity saw an increase of 270 per cent to US$ 493 million. Mergers and acquisition activities totaled US$ 585 million. Most acquisition activity was centered on biomass, small hydro and wind projects, according to UNEP report, Global Trends in Sustainable Energy Investment 2009.<br /><br />The Global Wind Energy Council in its report &ndash; &ldquo; Indian Wind Energy Outlook 2009&rdquo; estimates that there is a potential of around 90,000 MW for power generation from different renewable energy sources in the country, including 48,561 MW of wind power, 14,294 MW of small hydro power and 26,367 MW of biomass. In addition, the potential for solar energy is estimated for most parts of the country at around 20 MW per square kilometer of open, shadow free area covered with solar collectors, which would add to a minimum of 657 GW of installed capacity.<br /><br /><strong>POWER GROWTH PERSPECTIVE</strong><br />Today, India can well be identified as an energy guzzler. The demand for power is growing exponentially and the scope of growth of this sector is immense. India''s power supply-demand gap has averaged between 8 and 10 per cent over the last decade where electricity access exists. By 2012, India&rsquo;s energy requirement to touch 975,222 MU (and peak demand 1,571,070 MU) an increase of 31.9% and 44.3% respectively from the current demand. India''s grid-connected power generation capacity will need to scale from 148GW currently to 460GW by 2030 while the country''s primary energy demand is expected to grow from 400 million tons of oil equivalent to well over 1,200 million by 2030. It is feared that by 2030, the country will import 94% of its petroleum<br />requirement. Undoubtedly, renewable energy appears to be the most plausible option for the country to rely on.The average per capita consumption of energy in India is around 500 W, which is<br />much lower than that of developed countries like the United States, Europe, Australia, Japan, etc. However, this figure is expected to rise sharply due to high economic growth and rapid industrialization. Government of India aims to increase the per capita consumption of electricity to 1,000 units by year 2010, envisaged a capacity addition of 100,000 MW to meet the mission of &lsquo;Power for All by 2012. India&rsquo;s energy demand is increasing with the robust growth in economy. A steady forecasted growth for manufacturing sector would need more power generation in future. However, power generation through fossil fuels raises serious concern over the depleting resources and environmental pollution.<br /><br />Energy security is important for India, which is largely dependent on fossil fuel imports to foster its economic growth. According to the World Energy Outlook report, India will become the third largest net importer of oil before 2025 after the United States and China. This will not be sustainable in the long run given the high volatility of international crude oil prices. Coal imports are also likely to increase from 12 percent in 2005 to 28 percent in 2030. In order to insulate itself from any future supply disruption and price shocks of fossil fuels and to achieve energy security and also meet global climate change objectives Renewables have indeed caught the imagination of India. Riding on the crest of a high growth trajectory and in pursuit of sustainable sources to meet its rising domestic energy demand and access to energy for overall development the country is focusing on harnessing renewable energy production through maximizing the utilisation of renewable energy. The Government of India is convinced that Renewable source could make it possible to generate off-grid power to bridge this electricity deficit.<br /><br /><strong>RENEWABLES IN INDIA: POTENTIAL &amp; PROSPECTS</strong><br />India is the 4th largest country with regard to installed power generation capacity in the field of renewable energy sources and much is waiting to be discovered by it. Wind, Hydro, Biomass and Solar are main renewable energy sources. India has tremendous potentialities to harness the much-needed energy from renewable sources and considered as one of the ideal investment destinations for renewable energy equipment manufacturers and service providers. Wind energy has posted the highest growth. India could become top player in world''s solar market.<br />India intends to provide a reliable energy supply through a diverse and sustainable fuel mix that addresses major national drivers. These include security concerns, commercial exploitation of renewable power potential, eradication of energy poverty, ensuring availability and affordability of energy supply and preparing the nation for imminent energy transition.<br />The country has an estimated renewable energy potential of around 85,000 MW from commercially exploitable sources: Wind, 45,000 MW; small hydro, 15,000 MW and biomass/bioenergy, 25,000 MW. In addition, India has the potential to generate 35 MW per square km using solar photovoltaic and solar thermal energy. The Government of India has outlined ambitious capacity expansion and investment plans for the eleventh five year plan period (FY 2007- FY 2012). It has proposed an addition of 15,000 MW of Renewable Energy generation capacities during the period.<br />Wind Power projects form 70 percent (10,500 MW) of the proposed capacity addition, while Small Hydro Projects (SHP) accounts for 9.3 per cent (1,400 MW). The total investments on development of RE during the plan period is expected to be about USD 2 billion. The Greenpeace International, European Renewable Energy (EREC) in its report released in March, 2009 has projected that by 2050; about 69% of the electricity produced in India will come from renewable energy sources. &lsquo;New&rsquo; renewables &ndash; mainly wind, solar thermal energy and PV &ndash; will contribute almost 40%. The installed capacity of renewable energy technologies will grow from the current 38 GW to 1,659 GW in 2050, a substantial increase over the next 42 years. Upto 2030, wind will remain the main new power source. After 2020, the continuing growth of wind will be complemented by electricity from biomass, photovoltaics and solar thermal (CSP) energy.</p>');
